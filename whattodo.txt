Instructions on what I gotta check out and maybe add

Definitely Servertine (this):
2. DoorSetup allow runtime door editing on currently running doors. (maybe an added perk of choosing door systems through naming multidoors)
5. SectorControl module for Servertine (an optional manual changing utility)

New Connections:
GetServertineBootFiles
GetServertineFiles (now returns boot type too)
